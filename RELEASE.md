To release a new version of `pytest-run-parallel`:
1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`, remove `-dev` suffix
2. Open PR with the version change
3. After PR is merged, run git tag -a vX.X.X -m "Release vX.X.X"
4. Create a new release in GitHub pointing to the new tag. Use autogenerated
   release notes. Edit to remove any unnecessary stuff like the release PRs.
   Wheels will be uploaded automatically by `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
5. Increment minor version and append the `-dev` suffix in `pyproject.toml`
6. Open PR with the version change
7. Monitor [conda-forge feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/pytest-run-parallel-feedstock)
   for anything that might be off in the auto-generated (and automerged) PR.
